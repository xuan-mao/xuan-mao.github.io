els may be realistically derived.</p></li><li><p>We have <strong><u>so far</u></strong> ignored the potential role of cell kinetics. This may be a reasonable modelling assumption for certain systems, for example during the aggregation stages of Dictyostelium discoideum when cell proliferation has <strong><u>halted</u></strong>, or if the time-scale of movement is significantly faster than that of cell growth.</p></li><li><p>Along the paper we use the following notation
$$
⟨f⟩ := \frac1{\Omega}\int_\Omega f
$$
for the average value of function $f ∈ L^1(Ω)$.</p></li><li><p>Throughout the paper we denote generic constants by C which may vary line by line according to the context.</p></li><li><p>$C$ always denotes a generic positive constant.</p></li><li><p>Throughout this paper, the domain $\Omega$ and the non-trivial initial function $u_0$ are only confined to the following case:</p><ul><li><p>$\Omega$ is the open ball of radius $L$ with center at the origin in $R^N$.</p></li><li><p>$u_o$ is radially symmetric when $N \geq 2$.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Here we note that $W$ itself is bounded above for all times by the constant $nMR^n$, whereas the original function $u$ blows up if and only if the derivative $W_s(s, t) ≡ \frac1nu(r, t)$ does. Accordingly, we are interested in gradient blow-up in the problem (3.6), and as we shall see below, such behaviour occurs if $u_0$ is such that its initial mass is sufficiently strongly concentrated near $r = 0$.</p></li><li><p>We adopt the usual convention that two functions are considered equal if they <strong><u>agree</u></strong> except on a set of $\mu$-measure zero. Then we denote by $L_p(U, d\mu)$ (or simply $L_p(d\mu)$, $L_p(U)$ or even $L_p$) the Lebesgue-space of (all equivalence classes of) scalar-valued $\mu$-measurable functions $f$ on $U$, such that
$$
|f|<em>{L_p} = (\int_U|f(x)|^pd\mu)^{1/p}
$$
is finite. Here we have $1\leqslant p&lt;\infty$. In the limiting case, $p=\infty$,
$L_p$ consists of all $\mu$-measurable and bounded functions. Then we write
$$
|f|</em>{L_\infty}=\sup_U|f(x)|.
$$</p></li><li><p>Here we shall <strong><u>reproduce</u></strong> the elementary proof which was given by Thorin.</p></li><li><p>The theory of linear and quasilinear parabolic evolution equations, outlined so far, uses crucially the smoothing property of parabolic equations. This regularizing effect is the ultimate reason for the validity of global existence theorems based on a priori estimates in &lsquo;weak&rsquo; norms, that is, norms involving little regularity of the solutions only. &mdash;- Amann</p></li><li><p>First, the theory of monotone operators can sometimes be applied. However, it requires rather stringent conditions for the operators and nonlinearties and applies to a small class of problems only, <strong><u>leaving aside</u></strong> most systems of interest.</p></li><li><p>This lack of regularity renders it rather difficult - <strong><u>if not impossible</u></strong> - to develop a dynamical systems theory and to use techniques from nonlinear analysis to establish qualitative properties of the solution set.</p></li><li><p>It tells us, roughly speaking, that the quasilinear Cauchy problem (43) has the same behavior - as far as local existence and continuous dependence of the solutions on the data are concerned - as an ordinary differential equation: $y&rsquo; = P(t, y)$ in the finite-dimensional setting. In addition, since our solutions are weak $W^1_2$-solutions as well, they coincide on the common interval of existence with weak $W^1_2$-solutions obtained by any other method, <strong><u>provided</u></strong> there is a uniqueness theorem for weak $W^1_2$-solutions.</p></li><li><p>In the following, we <strong><u>adopt</u></strong> the usual convention not to distinguish (in notation) between a measurable function and its equivalence class modulo functions vanishing almost everywhere.</p></li><li><p>We <strong><u>remark</u></strong> that $\limsup$ in (1.1) for solutions of (P) can be replaced with $\lim$ (see [23,27]).</p></li><li><p>In two dimensions, <strong><u>to the best of our knowledge</u></strong>, the first result on finite-time blowup was shown in [19] for radial solutions of (JL) on a disk.</p></li><li><p>Under a <strong><u>restricted</u></strong> condition on $\partial\Omega$, we show the finite-time blowup of nonradial solutions, <strong><u>provided</u></strong> that $\int_\Omega u_0 d x > 4\pi$ and $\int_\Omega u_0 |x-q|^2dx$ is sufficiently small.</p></li><li><p>In our construction, to have solutions global in time, it is sufficient to obtain <strong><u>an a priori estimate</u></strong> on the $L^2(\Omega)$ norm of $(u, v)$ locally uniform in time. We will show such an estimate in certain cases in the next section, but here we would like to point out that in the case of $\Omega\subset R^3$, it <strong><u>suffices</u></strong> to have such an estimate only in $L^p, p > 3/2$. This follows from Amann’s theory of parabolic systems with nonlinear boundary conditions <strong><u>(a personal communication)</u></strong>.</p></li><li><p>Denoting by $f(t, x, v)$ the cell number density, at time $t$, <strong><u>position</u></strong> $x \in R^d$ moving with a velocity $v \in V$, the <strong><u>governing</u></strong> evolution equation of this process is described by a kinetic equation <strong><u>reading</u></strong> as:</p></li><li><p>The reader is referred to the monograph [7] for a thorough treatment of the elementary properties of Orlicz spaces.</p></li><li><p>where $\bar{u}<em>0:=\frac{1}{|\Omega|} \int</em>{\Omega} u(\cdot, T)$, and where $\lambda:=\min \left{\bar{u}_0, \lambda_1\right}$, with $\lambda_1>0$ denoting the <strong><u>principal eigenvalue</u></strong> of $-\Delta$ under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on $\Omega$.</p></li><li><p>denoting by $\omega_n$ the ($n − 1$)-dimensional measure of the sphere $\partial B_1$.</p></li><li><p><strong><u>This kind of generalization may be interesting from the modeling point of view.</u></strong> Indeed, different assumptions during the modeling process can lead to different terms in the equations and, therefore, it would be useful to have results for models with more general terms, rather than for a specific case.</p></li><li><p>We would also like to make a comment regarding the rigor of the calculations. We have observed that, in some papers on analysis of chemotaxis models, <strong><u>singular functions are taken as test function,</u></strong> as log(u) for instance. In the context of works such as [65] and [61], where, first of all, the authors prove the existence of local-in-time classical solutions, one could verify if it is possible to apply any strong “maximum principle” result to prove that u is strictly positive in the whole domain and then functions of the cell density u with singularity at zero can be used as test functions. <strong>Otherwise, according to our understanding, one should take actions to guarantee that all the computations carried out are rigorous.</strong></p></li><li><p>Some nonlinear analysis was carried out by Nanjundiah [4], whose surprising results <strong><u>stimulated the present study</u></strong>. Nanjundiah suggests that aggregation proceeds to the formation of $\delta$-functions in cell density, a phenomenon we refer to here as “chemotactic collapse.”</p></li><li><p>We thus have another <strong><u>instance</u></strong> of the critical role of dimensionality in determining the qualitative character of nonlinearly driven systems.</p></li><li><p>For the readers convenience and for future reference we will recall and explain some general (known) facts. These will be crucial in the rest of the paper. We recommend that a reader unfamiliar with such problems carefully verify these fact.</p></li><li><p>Throughout this paper, we <strong><u>denote a constant</u></strong> depending only on $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N$ for some $N \in \mathbb{N}$ as $C=C\left(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N\right)$.</p></li><li><p>After we completed this work, we <strong><u>learned</u></strong> that KATO & PONCE [34] extend their results, to solutions which may have infinite energy.</p></li><li><p>The basic tool for constructing solutions is a standard successive approximation scheme which <strong><u>goes back to</u></strong> LERAY [17] and is systematically studied in [10, 11, 14, 32, 33, 34].</p></li><li><p>We finally prove that our solution is persistent in the sense of Kato [15] and PonCE [27]. Although our argument is not <strong><u>original</u></strong>, we state our precise result since it concerns solutions with infinite energy and therefore is not contained in either [15] or [27]. <strong><u>In what follows</u></strong>, $W^{m, p}\left(R^2\right), m=0,1, \ldots$, denotes the usual Sobolev space. The norm of $W^{m, p}\left(R^2\right)$ is written as $|\cdot|_{W^{m, p}}$.</p></li><li><p>We shall continue in this section to work with a fixed measure space $(X, S, \mu)$, and to use the <u><strong>device</strong></u> of abbreviating &ldquo;simple function&rdquo; to &ldquo;function&rdquo;. Since all the methods of this section (with only one minor exception, occurring at the end of the proof of Theorem D) are based on the general results of the preceding section, it will turn out that not only the statements but even the proof of the following theorems will remain <strong><u>unaltered</u></strong> when we turn to the general case.</p></li><li><p>We shall <strong><u>adopt</u></strong> the following convention. If, for each point $x$ of a measurable space $(X,S)$, $\pi(x)$ is a proposition concerning $x$, and if $\mu$ is a signed measure on $S$, then the symbol $\pi(x)[\mu]$ or $\pi[\mu]$ shall mean that $\pi(x)$ is true for almost every $x$ with respect to the measure $|\mu|$. Thus, for instance, if $f$ and $g$ are two functions on $X$, we shall write $f=g[\mu]$ for the statement that ${x:f(x)\not=g(x)}$ is a measurable set of measure zero with respect to $|\mu|$. The symbol $[\mu]$ may be read as &ldquo;modulo $\mu$&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>We <strong><u>emphasize</u></strong> that a section of a set in a product space is not a set in that product space but a subset of one of the component spaces.</p></li><li><p>We shall see, however, that since the number $1$ plays a distinguished role in the formation of products (particularly of infinite products), the condition $\mu_i(X_i)=1$ is not merely an <strong><u>inessential</u></strong> normalization.</p></li><li><p>The general condition of countable additivity is a further restriction on $\mu$ &ndash; a restriction without which modern probability theory could not function. It is a tenable point of view that our intuition demands infinite additivity just as much as finite additivity. At any rate, however, infinite additivity does not contradict our intuitive ideas, and the theory built on it is sufficiently far developed to assert that the assumption is justified by its success.</p></li><li><p>Even if an actually infinite sequence of repetitions of an experiment is practically unthinkable, there is a point in considering infinite dimensional product spaces. The point is that many probability statements are assertions concerning what happens in the long run&ndash; assertion which can be made precise only by carefully formulated theorems concerning limits. Hence even if practice yields only approximations to infinity, it is the infinite sequence space that is the touchstone whereby the mathematical theory of probability can be tested against our intuitive ideas.</p></li><li><p>All that the verification requires, in addition to the obvious addition and subtractions, is the remark that, since the terms of a convergent series are bounded, the termwise product of two convergent series one of which has non negative terms is convergent.</p></li><li><p><strong><u>Intuitively</u></strong>, a function of bounded variation cannot oscillate too often with amplitudes that are too large. Some examples should help clarify this assertion.</p></li><li><p>The next result shows that in some sense the first example above (bounded, monotone and real-valued functions are of bounded variation.) <strong><u>exhausts</u></strong> all functions of bounded variation.</p></li></ul><h2 id=formalism>Formalism</h2><ul><li>By <strong><u>abuse</u></strong> of language we will write them in the differential form, which is <strong><u>formally</u></strong> obtained by taking the $L^2$ inner product of (1) and (2) with $u$, $v$, respectively, and integrating by parts. <strong><u>In the sequel</u></strong> we will be <strong><u>performing some formal calculations</u></strong> leading to differential inequalities, but we will <strong><u>understand</u></strong> them in the proper integral formulation like the energy relations above.</li><li>In the sequel we will not write explicitly the <strong><u>dependence</u></strong> of the <strong><u>considered</u></strong> functions on $t$,</li></ul><h2 id=deduction>Deduction</h2><ul><li>differentiating (1.4) <strong><u>with respect to time</u></strong> gives</li><li>We detail the proof for the case when δ is positive, leaving to the reader the <strong><u>minor modifications</u></strong> necessary for the limit case δ = 0.</li><li>from which Lemma 2.5 follows <strong><u>after integration with respect to time.</u></strong></li><li><strong><u>Gathering</u></strong> the previous three identities <strong><u>leads us to</u></strong></li><li>It <strong><u>follows</u></strong> from (1.4a) and Hölder’s and Young’s inequalities that</li><li>We now <strong><u>use</u></strong> Young’s inequality to <strong><u>obtain</u></strong></li><li>the standard continuity argument <strong><u>applied</u></strong> to (36) <strong><u>guarantees</u></strong></li><li>With this choice, if α > 0 is sufficiently small, we <strong><u>find</u></strong></li><li><strong><u>by</u></strong> the standard convering argument,</li><li>where $R > 0$ and $T ∈ (0, 1)$ will be fixed <strong><u>below</u></strong>.</li><li>multiplying the first two equations by $r^{n−1}$ and

smoothness.</li><li>In particular, theorem 10.1 in Chapter III of [13] gives the Hölder continuity: $u, v \in C^{\alpha, \alpha / 2}(\Omega \times(0, T))$ with some $\alpha \in(0,1)$, and the Hölder constant is locally bounded in $(x, t)$. <strong><u>Under assumptions on the supplementary regularity of the boundary</u></strong> $\partial \Omega \in C^{2+\alpha}$, and the Hölder continuity of $\langle u, v\rangle$ restricted to the parabolic boundary of $\Omega \times(0, T)$ (with suitable compatibility conditions on $\partial \Omega \times{0})$ we can obtain $C^{2+\alpha, 1+\alpha / 2}(\bar{\Omega} \times[0, T])$ regularity of solutions, which are in this case the classical ones, cf. e.g. [13, Chapter III, Section 12].</li><li>The general case is proved by <strong><u>exhausting</u></strong> the domain fi by an increasing sequence of smooth
domains $\Omega_k$ for which (31) with the condition $\Phi_k = 0$ on $\partial\Omega$ is solved.</li><li>At the cost of some technical expense, on the basis of Theorem 2.1 and the ideas in [6], it is possible to extend the above result to less regular initial data: <strong><u>Upon</u></strong> an approximation argument, namely, one can assert global existence of small-data weak solutions with the asymptotic properties (2.2) and (2.3) for initial data with possibly discontinuous $u_0$ and $\nabla v_0$, satisfying only (2.1).</li><li>This result <strong><u>suggests</u></strong> a <strong><u>negative</u></strong> answer to Nanjundiah’s conjecture, which is the possibility of blow-up. Unfortunately, removing the smallness condition on $\tau > 0$ and the assumption of radial symmetry has been left as an open problem.</li><li>We should add that the exact value of $A$ in the inequality is unimportant for us. What matters is that this constant be independent of $\alpha$ and $f$.</li></ul><h2 id=uncertainty>Uncertainty</h2><ul><li>it is not certain that</li></ul><h2 id=acknowledgements>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2><ul><li>We would like to thank the referee for several thoughtful comments and for pointing out how to simplify certain calculations in step III of the proof of the main result in an earlier version of this paper.

to naturally capture important phenomena not easily observed in standard diffusion models, including <strong><u>propagation over long spatial distances over short time scales and the emergence of localized infection hotspots.</u></strong></li><li>In fact, the above may reasonably describe certain behaviours in E.coli and other bacteria; which are shown to demonstrate both attractant responses to substances such as food, and repellent responses from <strong><u>noxious</u></strong> or <strong><u>toxic</u></strong> substances.</li><li>Equations of the sort we have used, to represent release of a signal (morphogen) by a group of cells and the cells’ own chemotactic response to this signal, constitute a system with sufficient <strong><u>“positive feedback”</u></strong> that above a certain critical density, the cells can aggregate.</li><li>This aggregation occurs on account of small, naturally occurring random fluctuations (“system noise”), with respect to which the system is unstable. The instability accelerates, in the sense that the <strong><u>rate of growth</u></strong> in regions of high concentration of cells increases with the concentration of cells.</li><li>The end-point (in time) of the aggregation is such that the cells are distributed in the form of $\delta$-function concentrations.</li><li>While the functional forms of the parameters involved in the equations may be more complicated in any given problem, a general conclusion, as we have drawn regarding stream-formation, <strong><u>will always hold so long as the broad features of the system remain the same</u></strong>. That is, in any system of cells with cooperative steady signalling, if the cells show positive chemotaxis to the signal, the morphology of localized cell aggregation has a streaming appearance.</li><li><strong><u>Remember that</u></strong> even though we got this result from linear analysis, non-linearities had to be considered to guarantee that whenever aggregation was initiated, it went to completion, and the morphological theorem remained valid.</li><li><strong><u>It was here that</u></strong> the functional parameters had to be given specific forms.</li><li>To sum up : a streaming morphology is diagnostic of cooperative signalling in aggregation. <strong><u>It must be stressed that</u></strong> our results are nowhere dependent on a pre-differentiation of cell types; biological noise in an overall uniform system is suffcient to initiate morphogenesis (Turing, 1952). Similar cases are well known in physics (e.g. see Whitehead (1971) for an account of cellular convection patterns in liquids).</li></ul></article><div class=paginator><a class=link href=https://aunomax.github.io/post/hello-world/>← prev</a>
